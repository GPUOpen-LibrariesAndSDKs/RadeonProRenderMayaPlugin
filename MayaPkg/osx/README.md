To create a Maya dmg with the installer do the following:
- build the Maya for mac plugin using the frMaya repo
	- this will be updated to the new repo soon
- run the open_installer script
	- Create the app
- run the build_dmg script

Very simple for now and no hardware checks are being done.

4dpipeline did not leave us a mac installer so I have had to recreate this one.
