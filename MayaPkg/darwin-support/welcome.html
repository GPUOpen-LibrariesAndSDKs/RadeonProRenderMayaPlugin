The installer will take you through the steps for setting up the Radeon ProRender Maya plug-in.

A key is required for installing the plug-in.  A prompt will be shown with a web page that will allow you  to acquire the key.

After the installation process completes successfully, run the postinstall application to connect the Radeon ProRender plug-in with the Maya distributions on disk.  This step will install module file(s) that allows Maya to add the Radeon ProRender plugin to the Plugin Manager list.

Additionally, the uninstall application can be run at a later time to remove the link between the Maya distributions and the plug-in.

The postinstall and uninstall applications can be found on the installer dmg.

Thank you for installing Radeon ProRender.
